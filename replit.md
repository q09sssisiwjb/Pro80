# Overview

Visionary AI is a comprehensive AI tools platform offering a suite of AI-powered image generation and manipulation capabilities. Built as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, it provides features such as text-to-image generation, background removal, image upscaling, sketching, and image-to-image transformation. The platform aims to deliver a modern user experience with a dark-themed UI, community gallery, and efficient access to AI tools.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, utilizing Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for styling, React Query for server state management, and Wouter for lightweight routing. Vite is used for fast development and optimized production builds.

## Backend Architecture
The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript, following a RESTful API design pattern. It operates on Node.js 18+ with ESM modules, features centralized route registration, global error handling, and custom logging middleware.

## Data Storage Solutions
The application employs a flexible storage abstraction, primarily using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for persistent storage. An automatic fallback to in-memory storage is implemented if the database is unavailable. Drizzle Kit is used for type-safe database schema management and migrations.

## Authentication and Authorization
Firebase Authentication is integrated for comprehensive user management, supporting email/password and Google OAuth. Firebase token-based authentication handles sessions, and React hooks manage authentication state.

## Component Design System
A comprehensive UI component library, built on Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui components, ensures consistent styling. It features a dark mode theme system using CSS variables, and uses Inter and Space Grotesk fonts. The design adopts a mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints.
